# Personal Course Website – Project 1, Part 1

## Deployed Website
https://reesej04.github.io/

## Purpose
This website introduces me and provides a Projects section that will host my Intro to AI course work, including a future game in Part 2.

## AI Usage Note
I used an AI assistant to help draft the HTML structure and generate the required SDLC documentation files (README, DESIGN, and TESTING). I reviewed and edited the generated content to ensure it accurately reflects the website I built and verified that the deployed site functions correctly.

# DESIGN – Project 1, Part 1

## Page Structure

The website is organized as a single-page layout with the following sections:

- Header: My name and the course title (Intro to AI – AI 109)
- About Section: A short paragraph introducing myself
- Projects Section: A list of course projects, including a placeholder for Project 1, Part 2 (JavaScript Game)
- GitHub Profile Link: A link to my GitHub account

## Layout Choices

I chose to use a single-page layout to keep the website simple and easy to navigate. All required sections are stacked vertically, making the page easy to read on both desktop and mobile devices. I used basic HTML structure without complex styling to ensure the site remains clean, lightweight, and fully static as required by the assignment.

## Design Rationale

I organized the website from most important information to supporting information. The header clearly identifies who I am and the course. The About section gives context about my background and interests. The Projects section highlights the purpose of the site and prepares it for future additions in Part 2. This structure ensures clarity, readability, and alignment with the assignment requirements.
